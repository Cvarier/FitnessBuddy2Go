# FitnessBuddy2Go
FitnessBuddy2Go is an intuitive and versatile physical fitness Android app that enables one to generate an exercise routine based on one's physical parameters. Most of the exercises within the app do not require equipment, which make it extremely convenient and fully portable.

Unlike most workout generating physical fitness apps on the market, FitnessBuddy2Go's workout generation algorithm takes into account the user's physical fitness level at the time of workout generation, as well as crucial health factors such as the user's BMI (calculated with given weight and height) and age. 

The app features thirty exercises grouped into three categories: strength, endurance, and balance + flexibility, all of which can be accessed and viewed in the included exercise library. All the descriptions of the exercises are handwritten.
